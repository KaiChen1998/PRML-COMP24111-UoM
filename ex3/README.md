# Lab3: Naïve Bayes Classifier for Spam Filtering (Unsupervised Learning Part)
This lab aims at implementing Naive Bayes classifier on classical UCI spam e-mail dataset
## Part 1: KNN Classifier
- Use a way like Ensemble Learning —— Generate 50 datasets first and get average result finally
- Exploring KNN training and testing accuracy
- Leave-One-Out Cross Validation to choose hyperparameter k

## Part 2: Linear Classifier
- Use basic Least Square loss function and Normal Equation
- Use other methods to tell a classifier performance, like precision, recall, F-value and so on. In this case, I use object prediction precision to check the classfier performance
