# Lab3: Na√Øve Bayes Classifier for Spam Filtering (Unsupervised Learning Part)
This lab aims at implementing Naive Bayes classifier on [classical UCI spam e-mail dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase)

## Part 1: Discrete Naive Bayes
- Modify original sapmbase dataset to discrete ones.
- In this part we need to deal with attributes with arbitrary number of possible values and arbitrary number of classes. 

## Part 2: Continuous Naive Bayes
- Use Continuous Naive Bayes on a given continuous dataset
- Implement 10-folder cross validation on original spambase dataset and get an average accuracy of over 80%.

### Important conclusion: Discrete Naive Bayes classfiers outperform continuous ones.
